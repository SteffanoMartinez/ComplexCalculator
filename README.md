Complex calculator for AC Circuit Analysis

A couple things to remember:

1.) There might be an error that I didn't manage to test so if doubtful use Wolfram alpha to recheck any results.


2.) Any input must be an actual real number (sqrt(2) = 1.41...)

I would gladly love any feedback and if you can optimize this (using an object-oriented approach) please let me know at: steffanomart2019@fau.edu.

Hope this helps you!
